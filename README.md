# Rubik's Cube Solver

This is my first project in rust, the implementation wasn't as important to me as getting familiar with the language.
But if you're interested it started as a basic DFS, and then grew to [IDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) and lastly into a more generic [IDA*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*) using [Korf's Algorithm.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_solutions_for_the_Rubik%27s_Cube#Korf's_algorithm)

This solver will find optimal (least moves) solutions.

Huge thanks to https://github.com/pnotequalnp for his Cubing and Rust knowledge.
